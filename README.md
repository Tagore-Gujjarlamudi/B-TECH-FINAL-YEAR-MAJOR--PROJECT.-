# B-TECH-FINAL-YEAR-MAJOR--PROJECT.- YOGA POSE RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING 
Yoga Posture Recognition Using Deep Learning Techniques :-

Abstract: In todayâ€™s digital world, online platforms have become increasingly popular for yoga instruction, especially during the pandemic. However, a significant challenge remains for beginners practicing alone: the lack of real-time feedback on their posture, leading to potential long-term body alignment and health issues. This paper proposes a solution by comparing two leading approaches for automatic yoga posture recognition: the Y_PN-MSSD model and the PoseNet CNN model. The Y_PN-MSSD model integrates PoseNet and MobileNet SSD (collectively known as TFLite MoveNet) to provide real-time feedback. PoseNet handles key point detection, while MobileNet SSD detects human presence in each frame. Data from both four users and an open-source yoga dataset are used to train the models, extracting key body points and recognizing seven distinct yoga poses. The Y_PN-MSSD model achieves an impressive 99.88% accuracy, outperforming the traditional PoseNet CNN model in both precision and speed. This comparative study shows the Y_PN-MSSD model's potential to be a practical, cost-effective solution for beginners seeking real-time assistance in yoga practice.
